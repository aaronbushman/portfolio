                        I was born in Richmond, Virginia but moved to a small town in the Shenandoah
                        Valley when I was five and spent my school years there. I eventually wound up back in Richmond,
                        Virginia as a student at Virginia Commonwealth University. I graduated from there in 2008 during
                        the height of the economic downturn and the only job I could find at the time with my very
                        practical Art History BA was a management gig at a paint store.</p>

                        <p>It worked for me for about a decade but I rapidly became burnt out over the last few years.
                        After exploring various paths out of that career and into something better, it became clear to
                        me that the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Richmond was the place for me. Now I'm plugging
                        my way through the class and can confidently say that this was probably one of my better life
                        decisions. I've since quit my old job and won't ever look back. I couldn't be happier with my
                        decision to enter this program.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not punching away at my keyboard for the Bootcamp, I find myself usually up to my eyes
                        in old vinyl records. I'd always been a collector of some sort as a kid; whether it be comics,
                        baseball cards or even baseball caps. I was always accumulating something. I had always enjoyed
                        listening to music more than most so the marriage of my love of music and my collecting gene
                        would eventually culminate in an obsessive record collecting habbit in my late teens that's
                        lasted to this current day at the age of 36. I'm not a hoarder by any means as I do have a focus
                        in my collecting. Genre wise I focus mainly on jazz, soul, funk and rock from the 60s and 70s;
                        generally of the weirder and obscure variety. I've also drifted in interest towards the no hit
                        wonders of Virginia and spend a lot of time and money tracking down their original pressings and
                        sometimes even discovering incredible long forgotten recordings. It's a fun hobby and has gotten
                        me invited to dj in numerous cities in the US and Europe and the opportunity to meet lots of
                        interesting people.</p>
